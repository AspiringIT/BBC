# Program 1: CHIP-8 Interpreter in C

## Overview

You will complete a [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) interpreter project in which all the icky graphics/sound/keyboard interfacing code is provided (`gui.c`) along with a basic automated test suite (`test.c`) by filling out the necessary functions in `chip8.c`.

Full [instructions](https://protect.bju.edu/cps/courses/cps230/progs/prog1) are on the CpS 230 course website.

## Submission

Complete `chip8.c` so that the project builds and runs and the automated tests all pass (hopefully).
Fill out the [standard program report template](report.md) MD file (submitted as `report.md`).
